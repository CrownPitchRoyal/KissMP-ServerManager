HELP:
 When you open the app, you have to select the Root directory in which all of your servers are located.
 The app will then check all folders for config.json and exe files that must have "server" in their name eg.: 1_server_utah.exe
 Once all servers are located it will display them on the right side. (Right side is informational only)
 On the left side there's a group of buttons that can be used to:
  - SHUTDOWN: Stop all running servers. It displays a message of all the running servers and asks you if you'd like them stopped.
  - REPLACE: Replaces all the files inside of each server's addons folder. Ask you for a folder form which the files are to be copied.
      (Very useful for batch updating)
  - REMOVE: Clears each server's addons folder.
  - START: Will start all the servers that are displayed on the right side of the app.
  - Selective Start: Displays two grids. Doubleclick any entry in left grid to copy it to the right one. Right one represents a list of all servers that are to be started.
    - Start Selected: Starts all servers,
    - Cancel: Closes the panel with grids,
    - Clear: Empties the right grid,
    - Clear Save: NOT IMPLEMENTED(Will clear any start config saved by "Save" button),
    - Save: NOT IMPLEMENTED(Will save the right grid to some file and then use it to load into the right grid as a preset).
  - Advanced: Remove limit of 10 servers max. To clear the limit click on "Advanced" and press no.,
  - HELP: Will take you here.
